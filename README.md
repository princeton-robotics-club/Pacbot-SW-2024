This repository contains code for an updated version of the Pacbot competition. Contributions are welcome (in the form of pull requests or issues), and please feel free to reach out to ih2422@princeton.edu if you have any questions regarding the game or client implementations.

There are three sub-folders, one for each part of the competition infrastructure:
* `bot_client`: sample Python code for creating a Pacbot high-level client and algorithm
* `server`: a Go (programming language) implementation of the Pacbot server and game engine
* `web_client`: a Svelte-based (JavaScript web frontend) client to serve as a visualizer and game console
